Designed to gently rotate during suspension, LYFE nourishes life with 360 degrees of sunlight exposure, 365 days a year.
- LYFE is a zero-gravity growing system allowing you to cultivate your favorite plants in mid-air.
- LYFE Planter: Our 12-sided geodesic planter is moulded from silicon, making it grippy and tactile. As it rotates in mid-air, different shades appear, providing a hypnotic and relaxing experience for your home of office. Watch your plant twirl in the air, and experience it from different angles.
- LYFE Reservoir: To mitigate against over-watering, a cleverly designed drainage system allows water to escape to a hidden, inner reservoir.
- LYFE Magnet: This is where the magic happens. Our custom shaped LYFE magnet pushes up against an electromagnetic base, causing the planter to levitate in mid-air, lifting your LYFE to new dimensions.Sells for $299 new: https://flytestore.com/products/lyfe-levitating-planter
